To run this project you will need to have GameMaker Studio installed on your computer. Install GameMaker and then clone the Repo from this address: https://github.com/LukeAFarthing/GhoulsAndGobstoppers. Once that is done open up GameMaker, click on the game and run it straight from the game files!
## Background
GhoulsAndGobstoppers is an isometric puzzle game based on the works of Earthbound and the Mother franchise. You play as Billy as he tries to save his neighborhood from all the ghosts that are stealing candy in the neighborhood and ruining Halloween. You will have to avoid ghosts and use Billy's magical guitar to defend yourself. You will also have access to "Ghost Vision", which can show you items hidden around the map. To defeat all the ghosts you need to find the four magical music sheets hidden throughout the level. If you collect all of the sheets without losing "HOPE" you will send all the ghosts back to the underworld and save Halloween.
## Controls
#### By using the ARROW KEYS you will be able to move Billy around the screen, to maneuver past the ghosts.
#### Pressing X will stun the ghosts for a short duration, allowing you time to grab items around the stage.
