## Background
GhoulsAndGobstoppers is an isometric puzzle game based on the works of Eathebound and the Mother franchise. The player has to avoid ghosts and use their magical guitar to defend themselves. The character must use items they find around and change the time of day with the guitar to end the ghost's reign of terror once and for all.
## Controls
By using the ARROW KEYS you will be able to move Billy around the screen, to maneuver past the ghost.
Pressing x will stun the ghost for a short duration, allowing you time to grab items around the stage.
